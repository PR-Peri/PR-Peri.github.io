        <p style="color:white"> I find it amazing to watch as the digital revolution sculpts society at a rate that has
            never
            before
            been seen, there is so much to still be discovered. Big data industry is a topic that particularly interests
            me,
            stemming from my studies and keen interest in statistics. I would like to explore on how these interfaces
            work,
            the
            theory behind computers and its methodology.

        <p style="color:white"> I completed my Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science, with a major of Data Science at
            Multimedia
            University (MMU), Malaysia. To me, data science is an interdisciplinary field that consists of math,
            statistics,
            software, and algorithmic thinking. On top of those, depending on what we work on, domain knowledge can be a
            significant requirement. Thus, I accepted there is too much to learn and it’d be an unnecessary burden to
            even
            try.

        <p style="color:white"> During my university days, I spent most of my time joining hackathons to understand what
            is
            truly
            on
            demand and which path I should focus on more.
            So, I took a lot of interesting courses like Visual Information processing, Data Mining, Digital Forensics,
            Computer
            Architecture, and many more subjects to completely immerse myself in big data and machine learning.

        <p style="color:white"> I'm fascinated by the power of a good motto.
            By definition, it's a brief statement "used to express a principle, a goal, or an idea” or a statement
            “adopted
            as a
            guide to one's conduct.”
            Complicated ideas get lost in space; simple mottos can help you remember what’s really important in an
            instant.
            I have decided to adopt the motto, to remind me to focus.
            <b>
                <blockquote>
                    <i> "In order to be irreplaceable, one must always be different" </i>
                </blockquote>
