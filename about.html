    <p style="color:white"> I find it amazing to watch as the digital revolution sculpts society at a rate that has never
        before
        been seen, there is so much to still be discovered. Big data industry is a topic that particularly interests me,
        stemming from my studies and keen interest in statistics. I would like to explore on how these interfaces work,
        the
        theory behind computers and its methodology.
    </p>

    <p style="color:white"> I completed my Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science, with a major of Data Science at Multimedia
        University (MMU), Malaysia. To me, data science is an interdisciplinary field that consists of math, statistics,
        software, and algorithmic thinking. On top of those, depending on what we work on, domain knowledge can be a
        significant requirement. Thus, I accepted there is too much to learn and it’d be an unnecessary burden to even
        try.
    </p>

    <p style="color:white"> During my university days, I spent most of my time joining hackathons to understand what is truly
        on
        demand and which path I should focus on more.
        So, I took a lot of interesting courses like Visual Information processing, Data Mining, Digital Forensics,
        Computer
        Architecture, and many more subjects to completely immerse myself in big data and machine learning.

    <p style="color:white"> I’m fascinated by the power of a good motto.
        By definition, it's a brief statement "used to express a principle, a goal, or an idea” or a statement “adopted
        as a
        guide to one’s conduct.”
        Complicated ideas get lost in space; simple mottos can help you remember what’s really important in an instant.
        The motto I have been following throughout my career is I've decided to adopt the motto,
        <b>
            <i> "In order to be irreplaceable, one must always be different" </i>
        </b>
        to remind me to focus.
