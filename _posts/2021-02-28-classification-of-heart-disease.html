        <h2 class="section-heading" style="color:rgb(37, 217, 241)" ;> Overview</h2>
        <p> Among all fatal diseases, heart diseases are considered as the most prevalent. Medical practitioners
            conduct
            different types of surveys on heart diseases and gather details of heart patients, symptoms and disease
            progression.
            Increasingly, it has been reported about patients with common diseases who have typical symptoms.
        </p>
        <p> On the
            other hand,
            people easily forget to take care of themselves due to the work pressure. In this type of lifestyle they
            are
            often
            stressed and it causes them to have blood pressure, diabetic, etc at very young age just because they do
            not
            give
            enough rest to the body. Not only that, improper diet also plays a major role in getting heart diseases,
            for
            instance unstable eating habits, consuming medicines without consulting doctors as a result all of these
            small
            negligence leads to a major threat.
        </p>

        <p> Preventing Heart diseases has become more than necessary. Good data driven systems for classifying heart
            diseases
            can improve the prevention process and entire research, making sure that more people can live healthy
            lives.
            Machine learning helps in classifying the heart diseases, and the predictions made are quite accurate
            based on few research paper.
            The aim
            of this project is to use the historical medical data to predict cardiovascular heart disease
            using machine learning techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
            The scope of this research is is show the effect of feature
            correlation on the classification model with over four different algorithms namely, Logistic
            Regression, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest and Artificial Neural Network. Those algorithms are used to
            analyze and to identify which techniques are the best suited technique which are effective to achieve
            high accuracy in classification of heart disease.

        <h2 class='section-heading' , style="color:rgb(37, 217, 241)" ;>Proposed Model</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Naïve Bayes</b> is a surprisingly powerful algorithm for predictive modeling. It is a statistical
            classifier
            which assumes no dependency between attributes attempting to maximize the posterior probability in
            determining the class. Theoretically, this classifier has the minimum error rate, but may not be the case
            always. Inaccuracies are caused by assumptions due to class conditional independence and the lack of
            available probability data. This model is associated with two types of probabilities which can be calculated
            from the training dataset directly:
        <ul>
            <li>The probability of every class.</li>
            <li>The conditional probability of each class with each x value. </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            According to Bayesian theorem P(A|B)=P(A)∗P(B/A)/P(B) , where P(B|A)=P(A∩B)/P(A) .
            Bayesian classifier calculates conditional probability of an instance belonging to each class, based on the
            above formula, and based on such conditional probability data, the instance is classified as the class with
            the highest conditional probability. If these probabilities are calculated, then the probabilistic model can
            be implemented to make predictions with new data using Naïve Bayes Theorem. When the data is real-valued it
            is likely to assume a Gaussian distribution (bell curve). Thus, these probabilities can easily be estimated.
        </p>
        <p>
            Naïve Bayes is called Naïve because of assuming each input variable independent. This classifier algorithm
            uses conditional independence, means it assumes that an attribute value on a given class is independent of
            the values of other attributes.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Random Forest</b> is one of the most renowned and most powerful machine learning algorithms. It is one
            kind of
            machine learning algorithm that is called Bagging or Bootstrap Aggregation. In order to estimate a value
            from a data sample such as mean, the bootstrap is a very powerful statistical approach. Here, lots of
            samples of data are taken, the mean is calculated, after that all of the mean values are averaged to give a
            better prediction of the real mean value.
        </p>
        <p> In bagging, the same method is used, but instead of estimating the
            mean of every data sample, decision trees are generally used. Here, numerous samples of the training data
            are considered and models are generated for every data sample. While a prediction for any data is needed,
            each model gives a prediction and these predictions are then averaged to get a better estimation of the real
            output value.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Logistic regression</b> is a technique of machine learning which is taken from the field of statistics.
            This method can be used for binary classification where values are distinguished with two classes. Logistic
            regression is similar to linear regression where the goal is to calculate the values of the coefficients
            within every input variable. Unlike linear regression, here the prediction of the output is constructed
            using a non-linear function which is called a logistic function.
        </p>
        <p>
            The logistic function transforms any value
            within the range of 0 to 1. The predictions made by logistic regression are used as the probability of a
            data instance concerning to either class 0 or class 1. This can be necessary for problems where more
            rationale for a prediction is needed. Logistic regression works better when attributes are unrelated to
            output variable and attributes correlated to one another are removed.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Artificial neural networks</b> also called Multilayer Perceptron is a supervised neural network
            architecture with one input layer, one or more hidden layers and one output layer. The input layer receives
            external inputs and then it will redistribute them to the neurons in the hidden layer. The hidden layer is
            made up of computational neurons, these neurons detect the features hidden in the input data. The features
            detected by neurons in the hidden layer are then used by the output layer to determine the final output of
            the network. Once the architecture of a Multilayer Perceptron is determined, the weight of the network has
            to be computed through a training process. The training is based on a desired network and training pattern
            output. Backpropagation algorithm is used as a training algorithm for Multilayer Perceptron.

        <p>
            From the diagram, we can see that Logistic Regression outperforms for Hungary and Statlog dataset
            whereas
            Artificial Neural Networks outperforms for
            Cleveland Dataset. Overall, The least amount of accuracy is prodcued by Naïve Bayes for Hungary dataset.
            After
            further analysis, we have discovered that Naïve Bayes did not perform well due to having higher bias but
            lower variance
            compared to Logistic Regression. If the data set follows the bias then Naïve Bayes will be a better
            classifier. Both Naïve Bayes and Logistic Regression are
            linear classifiers, Logistic Regression makes a prediction for the probability using a direct functional
            form whereas Naïve Bayes
            figures out how the data was generated given the results.

            The training and testing data are splitted up as 80% and 20% where the 80% is used for training and 20%
            is
            used
            for
            testing. I have implemented the real time prediction model for all the three datasets that I have worked
            on.
            The
            SHAP plot shows features that contribute to pushing the output from the base value or average model
            output
            to
            the actual predicted value. The red color, indicates features that are pushing the prediction higher
            whereas blue color indicates pushing the prediction lower.

            The diagram shows an example of a patient from
            Cleveland's dataset having to be predicted of being diagnosed with heart disease. The value of the
            features,
            causing increased predictions are in red, and their visual size shows the magnitude of the feature's
            effect.
            Feature values decreasing the prediction are in blue. The biggest impact comes from
            ‘chest_pain_type_atypical
            angina’ due to its value being stated as 1.
