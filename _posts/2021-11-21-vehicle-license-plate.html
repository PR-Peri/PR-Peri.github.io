        <p>Transportation plays a big role in human life no matter transporting goods or humans. Many countries had set
            up some traffic cameras on major roads such as highways to observe vehicular traffic for safety purposes.
            Therefore, it is essential to identify the vehicle license plate effectively. In this paper, a comparison of
            three machine learning techniques is proposed to evaluate the accuracy of recognizing the vehicle license
            plate character after performing the license plate detection and character segmentation </p>

        <h2 class="section-heading" style="color:rgb(37, 217, 241)" ;> Introduction</h2>
        <p>There are always vehicle-related crimes and traffic jams occurring all over the world. License plate
            detection or Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) or some would even call it License plate Recognition
            (LPR) is something that is constantly seeking for monitoring and easing investigation that is related to
            vehicles. In addition to that, LPR also helps to provide better security, ticketless parking, and even
            plunge into the research of smart cities that use LPR to understand traffic. LPR is defined as the
            capability of capturing an image or a digital video of a license plate and transforming it into optical data
            that allows us to gather digital information from it.
            <br></br>

            Through the detection of license plates were able to derive and plate different types of information such as
            the type of vehicle, where it originated from, the driver's information, and finally, the records of
            complaints and warnings received by the vehicle. There are many attempts on creating the optimal LPR but
            there are different types of license plates being created all over the world, with different designs and
            state codes.
            <br></br>

            This project will be looking into the optimal method for license plate character recognition by implementing
            different algorithms and fine-tuning them to produce the best accuracy. This project will be using two
            datasets one that is sourced from Kaggle which has about 433 cars along with their license plate and the
            file size is about 212.88MB. The other set of data was collected from the members capturing car images in
            Malaysia. It contains 120 images of cars with Malaysian license plates.

        <h5 class="section-subtitle" style="color:rgb(37, 241, 139)" ;> Image Preprocessing</h5>

        <p>
            As mentioned in the introduction this project will be using two datasets, one sourced from Kaggle and
            another data was collected by the members.
            <br></br>

            Interference in the original input images like noise, distortion, size, and quality of the image will affect
            the recognition performances. To minimize these interference factors, preprocessing is required on the input
            image so that the quality of the image will be improved and save up computational time.
            <br></br>

            Figure below shows the original car image. First, color images to the grayscale conversion will be performed.
            It is a major step to speed up and ease the following imaging processes. After that, bilateral filtering
            will be applied to the gray image to remove the edge of noise surrounding the license plate, while
            preserving the edges of characters in the image sharp. Figure 3.2 displays the sample gray image after the
            bilateral filer was applied. This step can also ensure the algorithm avoids unrelated background details.
