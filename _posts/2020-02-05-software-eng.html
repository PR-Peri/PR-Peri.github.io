        <h2 class="section-heading" style="color:rgb(37, 217, 241)" ;> Introduction</h2>
        <p>Training is one of the most important parts of an organization’s overall Strategy. Before starting a
            particular venture or considering a potential acquisition, the first question arises that, whether there are
            required skills present in the organization or not. Typically all key skills required for efficient
            management of a company must be available in a company; however other non-core activities can be outsourced.
            The need for training arises due to advancement in technology, need for improving performance or as part of
            professional development.
            <br></br>

            Benefits of training are intangible and investing in training benefits both the organization and employees
            for a long period. Training enhances a worker level of skills. It provides a sense of satisfaction, which is
            an intrinsic motivator. Training also provides organization multi-skilled employees. Training increases an
            employer commitment to their job and their organization. A better understanding of jobs reduces accidents.
            <br></br>

            Training a teacher prepares them to carry out their humble educational activities effectively, and to
            achieve such an event depends on the ability of the teacher to give, and create and interact, and mastering
            sciences and the application of the different methods of teaching according to each learning situation, and
            it happens when the teacher manages their class firmly and successfully, and this management relies also on
            the teacher's personality and the style in dealing with students inside and outside the classroom. Real
            educational reform must be based on the teacher’s training.

        <h2 class="section-heading" style="color:rgb(37, 217, 241)" ;> Problem Statement</h2>
        <p> 1) Principal faces a challenge where he/she does not know, what kind of training the teachers underwent.
        <ul>
            <li>
                He/she had trouble finding for the records.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            2) Secretary faces a problem where he/she could not filter out the training that the teachers went
            through
            previously.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Secretary had issues on selecting candidates, that needs to be a part of the future training.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            3) As for the treasurer, he/she faces a huge problem with allocating money for each training.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Since the secretary could not decide, the number of candidates that would take part in the training,
                treasurer faces difficulties to finalize the total cost that will be needed.
            </li>

        <h2 class="section-heading" style="color:rgb(37, 217, 241)" ;> User Story</h2>
        <p> 1) Principal
        <ul>
            <li>
                As a principal, I want to have a record of the type of training each teacher underwent and wants to go
                through. I need to make sure that the teachers will undergo sufficient training that is necessary for
                them to perform their tasks.
            </li>
            <li>
                Benefits :
                By doing so, I will designate proper training that the teachers could use to enhance their skills by
                performing their tasks at school.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            2) Secretary
        <ul>
            <li>
                As a secretary, I feel that some of the training description are not accurate in terms of information
                and training plan. As for this problem, it is very difficult for me to make a decision or have a brief
                idea on the trainings.
            </li>
            <li> Before, selecting the candidates, I need to be able to provide a summary or main idea, due to improper
                information, I am having a tough time choosing training, based on the candidates requirements.
            </li>
            <li>
                Benefits :
                I need a system that will help me to prepare myself and the teachers by giving us a summary of what we
                will be learning in order to understand the whole course we will be attending.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            3) Treasurer
        <ul>
            <li>
                As a treasurer, my role is to stay updated with the school/university financial system. I have problems
                with the statements due to improper records or missing data from the files.
            </li>
            <li> Besides that, I could not analyse, if the money needed for the upcoming training would be affordable
                for the management.Not only that, I could not decide if the candidates are still allowed to go through
                the training if there are problems with the money allocation.
            </li>
            <li>Based on this situation, I would suggest the higher education authority to introduce a highly compatible
                software, so that it would be easier to interpret
            </li>
            <li>
                Benefits :
                With a better software, it would make our works to be carried out in a simpler method and in a faster
                time.
            </li>

        <h2 class="section-heading" style="color:rgb(37, 217, 241)" ;> Scope</h2>
        <p>
            Project scope is the first step in setting project goals and objectives. It also allows the team to assign
            resources and forming a reasonable project timeline. For the scope of the software, we decided to list out a
            few key points such as the programming language, user interface design and function of the systems.
            <br></br>

            We found out that picking the right programming language is important in developing software. We had to make
            sure that every team member is familiar with the language chosen to allow a smooth process in developing
            said software. After much discussion, the team decided to use the programming language C++ for the software.
            <br></br>

            The cross-platform C++ will be used. The team discovered that it is the best option to choose from to
            develop the software. The team also found that the benefits of using this platform outweigh the liabilities.
            <br></br>

            Employee Training Management system in this project is a standalone system, the team found out that any
            computer that could install the program can use this hardware. The software can run at any operating system
            and it does not require any other special software
            <br></br>

            The time allocated to finish up this program is 13 weeks including project meetings, consultation hours and
            implementation and testing of the test product.

        <h2 class="section-heading" style="color:rgb(37, 217, 241)" ;> Objectives</h2>
        <p>
            The objective is to create a program has the main menu for the admin that would allow admin to manage
            employee’s records, such as add employee record, view employee record, search employee record, edit employee
            record and delete employee record. Furthermore, the admin could also click on training status from the main
            menu to whether approve or reject the employee who applied for training. On the other hand, the program has
            the main menu for an employee that would allow an employee to manage their training status which includes
            training application, edit training application and training cancellation. Additionally, an employee could
            also view their profile under his/her main menu.
        </p>

        <p> 1) Self Service
        <ul>
            <li>
                The program needs to be manually controlled by the admin and the employee.

            </li>
            <li>
                Admin can delete an employee record.
            </li>

            To fully optimise our Training Management System, we decided to gather more information that could help
            make our system better. We decided to conduct a short survey and also make comparisons with current
            existing training systems. We asked some questions to our classmates and survey was done by using google
            survey.
