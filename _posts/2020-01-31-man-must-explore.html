        <h2 class="Overview"> Overview</h2>
        <p> Among all fatal diseases, heart diseases are considered as the most prevalent. Medical practitioners
            conduct
            different types of surveys on heart diseases and gather details of heart patients, symptoms and disease
            progression.
            Increasingly, it has been reported about patients with common diseases who have typical symptoms. On the
            other hand,
            people easily forget to take care of themselves due to the work pressure. In this type of lifestyle they
            are
            often
            stressed and it causes them to have blood pressure, diabetic, etc at very young age just because they do
            not
            give
            enough rest to the body. Not only that, improper diet also plays a major role in getting heart diseases,
            for
            instance unstable eating habits, consuming medicines without consulting doctors as a result all of these
            small
            negligence leads to a major threat.
        </p>

        <p> Preventing Heart diseases has become more than necessary. Good data driven systems for classifying heart
            diseases
            can improve the prevention process and entire research, making sure that more people can live healthy
            lives.
            Machine learning helps in classifying the heart diseases, and the predictions made are quite accurate
            based on few research paper.
            The aim
            of this project is to use the historical medical data to predict cardiovascular heart disease
            using machine learning techniques. The scope of this research is is show the effect of feature
            correlation on the classification model with over four different algorithms namely, Logistic
            Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest and Artificial Neural Network. Those algorithms are used to
            analyze and to identify which techniques are the best suited technique which are effective to achieve
            high accuracy in classification of heart disease.

    <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore
        strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

    <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our
        nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
